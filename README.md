## 🧭 About This Repository
This is an evolving collection of my cybersecurity, networking, and technical repair projects. As a student and aspiring Application Security Analyst, I'm using this space to practice real-world skills, track my bug bounty journey, and apply what I’ve learned at school, work, and through personal experimentation.
Expect to find notes on web vulnerabilities, Python scripts, hardware repairs, and hands-on recon as I build experience and contribute to the cybersecurity community.

Work in progress—but learning in progress, too.
